3220 - Project 4

# Design
    This is my FAT12 file recovery program. It consists of filerecovery.c, filerecovery.h, and a Makefile.
    The program works by reading in the bytes on the given image, separating them into the various FAT12 
    sectors, and parsing the sectors looking for files. Any found file is saved to the given output. 
    Starting in the ROOT, every entry is checked. If the entry is file the data is printed to stdout, 
    assigned to a File struct object, and saved to the specified output. If the entry is a subdirectory, 
    its entries are then parsed until an end is reached.

# Known Problems
    I had a hard time figuring out how to deal with if a subdirectory had more than 16 entries. I think I 
    was able to address this problem but I have not had time to test it so I don't really know.

    Also some of my type casting was causing errors, especially with the convertHex helper function.
