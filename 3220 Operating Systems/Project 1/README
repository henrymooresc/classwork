3220 - Project 1

# Description
This project consists of three files and a make file to compile them. 

leakcount.c runs a given file and keeps track of any calls to malloc and free. 
Upon completion of the child process the malloc and free calls are compared to 
find leaked memory. The leaked sizes are then output to stderr along with the 
total sum of the leaks.

memory_shim.c is the shim library to intercept calls to malloc and free. It 
logs the void pointers returned until the program completes. Once finished 
the calls are compared and any leaks are written to an output file.

sctracer.c runs a given file and keeps track of any system calls made. The 
system call numbers are recorded until the child process completes. Once done 
the calls are reviewed and counted for how many each call is made before being 
written to the given output file.

# Design
leakcount.c is pretty simple as its only real responsibility is to format the 
input correctly for execvpe and then reading/processing the results.

memory_shim.c creates the ability to intercept the calls to malloc and free 
made in the child process. The shim malloc and free functions simply store the 
void pointer returned from the original malloc and free functions into an array. 
The calculation of leaks is done in the destructor once the child process has 
completed. The array of malloc pointers is looped through and compared to the 
array of freed pointers. If a match is found, the size allocated is written to 
a file for leakcount.c to read. The matched entry in the freed array is also 
replaced with NULL so that it doesn't trigger a match again for any reused 
address spaces.

sctracer.c first has to parse the given file to run and its potential arguments. 
Since the file to be ran can be either a single arg or a string of args, a new 
argv array is made. The new argv is populated with whatever is given, using strtok 
to divide up the string if there are multiple args. Then a child process is made, 
sets up ptrace, waits for the parent process to be ready to trace, and calls execvp 
with the given file to run. The parent process loops until the child process ends, 
logging all system call numbers into an array. Upon completion the system call nums 
are ordered using qsort, counted, and the results written to the given output file.

# Known Problems
The memory_shim can only support a limited number of calls to malloc/free as I 
was unable to figure out how to get dynamically allocated arrays for storing calls 
working correctly. I thought I had managed it with realloc but not quite.

For the sctracer program, I realized I was expecting the wrong results from my 
manual testing after the last autograder run. I've modified sctracer.c to hopefully 
be getting the correct results now, but wasn't able to test it much beyond basic 
comparison with the results from strace. I also didn't have a good solution for my 
array logging the entry and exit for each system call except the exit_group, so 
I'm betting that my solution on lines 113-114 will cause issues.
