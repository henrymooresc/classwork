# CPSC3300 - Project 1

This project comprises of 3 parts. In the repository, you can see 3 folders - Task\_A, Task\_B and Task\_C.

1. Task\_A - Task A is about downloading and running a tool. After you clone the repository go to Task A directory and follow the instructions mentioned in the readme file.
2. Task\_B - In task B, you will compile and run the C programming code located in the Task B directory.
2. Task\_C - In task C, you will have to optimize the given code.

# Getting Started
1. Download the assignment from Canvas and upload it to your School of Computing directories
	a. `scp` <path/to/proj1.zip> `access1.computing.clemson.edu:/home/`<your_username_here>`/proj1.zip;` # Then unzip on a SoC machine
2. You may work on any platform for this project, but grading will utilize the School of Computing machines so it is your responsibility to ensure that all of your code compiles and runs as intended on the School of Computing machines.
	a. Specifically we will use the Linux machines in the SoC lab. See https://computing.clemson.edu/help/ for help with remote access to campus resources.

# Submission Instructions
1. Execute `./submit.zip` to zip up your submission content. Then upload this archive to Canvas.
	a. You may submit multiple times up until the assignment deadline. We will only grade your most recent submission.
	b. Per the syllabus policy late submissions may be allowed. It is generally not necessary to email the professor or TA to utilize this policy--we will see the submission time and grade it accordingly if you meet the requirements listed in the syllabus.
