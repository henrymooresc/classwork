    "There are two main installing packages for Python, `conda` and `pip`. Pip is the Python Packaging Authority’s recommended tool for installing packages from the **Python Package Index (PyPI)**. `Conda` is a cross platform package and environment manager that installs and manages conda packages from the **Anaconda repository** and **Anaconda Cloud**. Conda does not assume any specific configuration in your computer and will install the Python interpreter along with the other Python packages, whereas `pip` assumes that you have installed the Python interpreter in your computer. Given the fact that most operating systems do include Python this is not a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "If I could summarize their differences into a sentence it would be that conda has the ability to create **isolated environments** that can contain different versions of Python and/or the packages installed in them. This can be extremely useful when working with data science tools as different tools may contain conflicting requirements which could prevent them all being installed into a single environment. You can have environments with pip but would have to install a tool such as virtualenv or venv. You may use either, we recommend `conda` because in our experience it leads to fewer incompatibilities between packages and thus fewer broken environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion: Use Both.** Most often in our data science environments we want to combining pip with conda when one or more packages are only available to install via pip. Although thousands of packages are available in the Anaconda repository, including the most popular data science, machine learning, and AI frameworks but a lot more are available on PyPI. Even if you have your environment installed via `conda` you can use `pip` to install individual packages \n",
