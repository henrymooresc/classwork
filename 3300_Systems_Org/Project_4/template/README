CPSC 3300
Henry Moore
Project 4

# Description
This project is the implementation of a CPU simulator using MIPS instruction architecture.
It was made using Java and following the MVC design practice. A makefile is used for compiling
and running the program.

# Issues
I believe the given .bin file given as a translation of "input.asm" was incorrect. It appeared 
to have issues with the beq and sw statements.
